## Overview

You can use variables in the UI using the `${VARIABLE_NAME}` or `$VARIABLE_NAME` syntax.
These variables will be substituted into outgoing requests.

`.env` files can be loaded using the `--env` option.
Variables from these files can then be used in the UI.

## Example

Imagine you're testing an API which exists in both `dev` and `prod` environments.

The `dev` and `prod` environments share some common variables, but differ in many ways too.
We can model this by having a single `shared.env` file which contains variables which are shared between environments, and then a `dev.env` and `prod.env` file which contain environment specific variables.

```bash
# file: shared.env
API_PATH="/api/v1"
ENV_NAME="shared"

# file: dev.env
API_KEY="dev-api-key"
ENV_NAME="dev"
BASE_URL="https://${ENV_NAME}.example.com"

# file: prod.env
API_KEY="prod-api-key"
ENV_NAME="prod"
BASE_URL="https://${ENV_NAME}.example.com"
```

When working in the `dev` environment, you can then load all of the shared variables and all of the development environment specific variables using the `--env` option:

```bash
posting --env shared.env --env dev.env
```

This will load all of the shared variables from `shared.env`, and then load the variables from `dev.env`. Since `ENV_NAME` appears in both files, the value from the `dev.env` file will be used since that was the last one specified.

Note that you do *not* need to restart to load changes made to these files,
so you can open and edit your env files in an editor of your choice alongside Posting.
However, autocompletion and variable highlighting will not update until Posting is restarted.

If you want to permit using environment variables that exist on the host machine (i.e. those which are not defined in any `.env` files), you must set the `use_host_environment` config option to `true` (or set the environment variable `POSTING_USE_HOST_ENVIRONMENT=true`).

### Environment specific config

Since all Posting configuration options can also be specified as environment variables, we can also put environment specific config inside `.env` files. There's a dedicated "Configuration" section in this document which covers this in more detail.

For example, if you wanted to use a light theme in the prod environment (as a subtle reminder that you're in production!), you could set the environment variable `POSTING_THEME=solarized-light` inside the `prod.env` file.

Note that configuration files take precedence over environment variables, so if you set a value in both a `.env` file and a `config.yaml`, the value from the `config.yaml` file will be used.
